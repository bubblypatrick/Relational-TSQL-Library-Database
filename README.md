# The-Tech-Academy-SQL-Coding-Projects

My final project for the SQL Course. The end result is library network, a relational database consisting of 9 tables. I populated the data myself.

There are 3 branches, more than 50 books, authors, borrowers, rental logs, and publishers. At the bottom are stored procedures that query the database for searches that were asked for in the assignment. These include how many books are written by Steven King, how many borrowers have more than 6 books checked out, and how many copies of a Steven King book are a particular library branch.

I had never worked in SQL or databases before and worked hard to keep my code as nice as possible. I'm very proud of this one!
